# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

* Bump minimum supported Rust version to 1.44.0 (PR #243).
* Update `lsp-types` crate from `>=0.79, <0.82` to `0.85` (PR #243).
* Update `tokio` crate from `0.2` to `0.3` (PR #243).

## [0.13.3] - 2020-09-19

### Changed

* Increase `lsp-types` semantic version range to `>=0.79, <0.82`. This is safe
  because the upstream changes only concern proposed LSP features, which this
  library does not currently support.

## [0.13.2] - 2020-09-03

### Changed

* Increase `lsp-types` semantic version range to `>=0.79, <0.81`. This is safe
  because the upstream changes only concern proposed LSP features, which this
  library does not currently support.

## [0.13.1] - 2020-08-21

### Changed

* Improve `std::fmt::Debug` implementation for `Client` (PR #216).
* Several API documentation improvements.

### Fixed

* Fix infinite loop upon encountering invalid UTF-8 characters in an incoming
  message (PR #215).

## [0.13.0] - 2020-08-20

### Changed

* Improve log message quality and reduce noise.
* Return responses in corresponding request order to make things easier on the
  client side (PR #212).
* Change remaining `Client` notification methods to `async fn` (PR #213).
* Bump minimum supported Rust version to 1.41.0 (PR #213).

### Fixed

* Report missing params as "invalid params" instead of "parse error" (PR #211).

## [0.12.1] - 2020-08-11

### Fixed

* Reject multiple `initialize` requests sent in quick succession (PR #208).
* Fix bug deserializing `jsonrpc` field from `serde_json::Value` (PR #209).

## [0.12.0] - 2020-08-09

### Added

* Add private subcrate `tower-lsp-macros` for internal use only (PR #202).
* Implement cancellation support via `$/cancelRequest` (PR #202).
* Officially support serving over TCP (PR #198).

### Changed

* Update `lsp-types` crate from 0.74 to 0.79.
* Have language servers store `Client` directly as struct field (PR #199).
* Replace `jsonrpc-core` with minimal JSON-RPC implementation (PR #202).
* Redefine `LspService` as `Service<Incoming, Response = Option<Outgoing>>`.
* Implement `FusedStream` for `MessageStream`.

### Fixed

* Fix typo which caused `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` to break (PR #195).
* Implement proper parse error recovery in LSP codec (PR #201).
* Refuse to accept further requests after `shutdown` has been called once.

### Removed

* Remove dependency on `jsonrpc-core`, as `tower-lsp` no longer relies on it.
* Remove `LspService::with_handler()` constructor (PR #202).

## [0.11.0] - 2020-04-30

### Changed

* Update `lsp-types` crate from 0.73 to 0.74 (PR #178). This introduces breaking
  changes to the following `LanguageServer` trait method signatures:
  * `hover()`
  * `signatureHelp()`
  * `goto_declaration()`
  * `goto_definition()`
  * `goto_type_definition()`
  * `goto_implementation()`
  * `document_highlight()`
* Make `LanguageServer::initialize()` handler `async fn` (PR #182).
* Accept `stdin` and `stdout` handles that are not `Send + 'static`. This
  permits the use of `std::io::Cursor` or `Vec<u8>` as mock stdio sources for
  tests, and passing in `&mut` handles is now supported as well (PR #184).

### Fixed

* Fix broken bidirectional request/response routing (PR #184). The original
  implementation introduced in [0.9.0](#090---2020-03-04) would deadlock under
  certain conditions.

## [0.10.1] - 2020-04-29

### Changed

* Implement `Clone` for `Client` so it can be safely passed to functions
  expecting `'static` values.
* Mark `MessageStream` as `#[must_use]`.

## [0.10.0] - 2020-03-19

### Added

* Implement support for the following client-to-server messages:
  * `textDocument/willSaveWaitUntil`
  * `textDocument/selectionRange`
* Re-export useful `jsonrpc-core` types in a new `jsonrpc` module (PR #169).

### Changed

* Update `lsp-types` crate from 0.70 to 0.73 (PR #162).

### Fixed

* Fix JSON-RPC delegate for `textDocument/foldingRange` (PR #167).

## [0.9.1] - 2020-03-07

### Added

* Implement support for the following client-to-server messages:
  * `textDocument/documentColor`
  * `textDocument/colorPresentation`
  * `textDocument/rangeFormatting`
  * `textDocument/onTypeFormatting`
  * `textDocument/foldingRange`

### Changed

* Server will accept the `initialize` request from the client only once and will
  respond with JSON-RPC error code `-32600` if sent again (PR #160).

### Fixed

* Fix broken links and improve documentation (PRs #152 #157 #158).

## [0.9.0] - 2020-03-04

### Added

* Add `info!()` message when server initializes to be consistent with the
  existing `info!()` message that is emitted when the server exits.
* Implement support for the following client-to-server messages:
  * `textDocument/references`
  * `textDocument/documentLink`
  * `documentLink/resolve`
  * `textDocument/rename`
  * `textDocument/prepareRename`
* Implement support for the following server-to-client messages:
  * `window/showMessageRequest`
  * `workspace/workspaceFolders`
  * `workspace/configuration`

### Changed

* Improve LSP message encoding efficiency (PR #126).
* Reduce chattiness of `trace!()` logs (PR #130).
* Change all notification trait methods to `async fn` (PR #131).
* Implement proper server-to-client request routing (PRs #134 #135).
* Rename `Printer` to `Client`.
* Change `Client::apply_edit()` to return `Result<ApplyWorkspaceEditResponse>`.
* Change `Client::register_capability()` to return `Result<()>`.
* Change `Client::unregister_capability()` to return `Result<()>`.

### Removed

* Remove redundant serialization steps from `Client` (PR #129).

## [0.8.0] - 2020-02-28

### Added

* Implement support for the following client-to-server messages:
  * `textDocument/willSave`
  * `completionItem/resolve`
  * `textDocument/documentSymbol`
  * `textDocument/codeAction`
  * `textDocument/codeLens`
  * `codeLens/resolve`
  * `textDocument/formatting`

### Changed

* `LspService::call()` stops serving requests after `exit` notification,
  meaning there is no longer a need for `ExitReceiver::run_until_exit` and the
  `Server::serve()` async method can now be awaited directly (PR #117).
* Return `Option<String>` as service response type (PR #116).
* Disable unused `nom` features for a hopefully lighter build (PR #112).
* Link to current version of LSP specification in doc comments (PR #122).

### Fixed

* Correctly handle backpressure using `Service::poll_ready()` (PR #117).

### Fixed

* Allow `window/logMessage`, `window/showMessage`, and `telemetry/event`
  server-to-client notifications in `initialize` request (PR #48).
* Update links to the LSP specification website to point to the new URL.

## [0.3.1] - 2019-09-08

### Changed

### Changed

* Language server now returns server error code `-32002` if any method is called
  before `initialize` request is received, [as per the spec][init].
* `LspService` sets `Service::Error` to `ExitedError`.
* `Server` can now accept any service where `Service::Error` is convertible to
  `Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync>`. This enables compatibility with most Tower
  middleware.
* Retain error or success from future in `ExitReceiver::run_until_exit()`.
* Remove `'static` bounds on some `Server` and `ExitReceiver` methods.
